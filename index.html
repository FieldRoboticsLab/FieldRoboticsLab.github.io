Congratulations to our team members: Mustafa Bayrak, M. Buğra Ayhan, Ayşenur Yörür, Burak Rüstemoğulları, Zafer Tunçer. <br><br>

Our experience from last year's competition, combined with the hard work of our members, ultimately led us to this remarkable achievement. The VRX 2023, featuring 8 challenging missions, put our skills to the test in object detection, localization, and autonomous motion planning. We take pride in representing Istanbul Medeniyet University and Turkey in the biggest international simulation competition for autonomous surface vehicles. <br><br>

Thanks to RoboNation, Naval Postgraduate School, Open Robotics and each of 34 competitor teams for making this amazing competition possible. <a href="https://robotx.org/2023/11/17/vrx-2023-awards-and-final-standings/">#VRX2023</a></p>

                           Within the scope of the project, it is aimed to detect and track the instantaneous location of a moving target with a radio transmitter on it. The target does not follow any predetermined trajectory and speed.
                            Particle Filter based approach was used in the thesis, and the developed approach was tested in a simulation environment and field experiments. 
                            For the field experiments, a rotary-wing aerial robot was designed and manufactured to be used.
                            The thesis study carried out at Field Robotics Laboratory was successfully completed.

                        <h4 class="duyuru-baslik">[Competition] Team IMU and Team IMU FW are finalists in the TUBITAK UAV 2020 Competition</h4>
                        <p class="duyuru-aciklama">The Field Robotics Laboratory at Istanbul Medeniyet University participated in the TUBITAK UAV 2020 Competition with Team IMU in the rotary wing category and Team IMU FW in the fixed-wing category. 
                           Team IMU FW achieved 3rd place among 50 teams and Team IMU achieved 24rd place among 60 teams in the detailed design report.
                           
                           The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), after completing production and test flights, are capable of executing autonomous take-off, cruise, and landing missions. 
                           Equipped with a camera, they enable target recognition and positioning, while real-time monitoring of flight parameters is facilitated through the team's developed ground station. 
                           These UAVs possess the capability to autonomously pick up and drop off payloads to predetermined coordinates, all managed seamlessly through autonomous software, eliminating the need for human intervention.
                           We are pleased to announce that both of our teams successfully advanced to the finals of the competition.

                        <p class="duyuru-aciklama">The RoboDragos team is proudly representing Turkey in the SUAS 2020 competition, an annual event organized by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International  (AUVSI) since 2002.
                            Among 78 teams worldwide, our students have earned the opportunity to compete as one of the six teams from Turkey.

                           Taking place in St. Petersburg, USA, and Washington DC from June 17th to 20th, 2020, the competition will be hosted at Patuxent River Naval Air Station (NAS) in Mary's County, Maryland. 
                           The tasks include designing an unmanned aerial system capable of autonomous flight and navigation, integrating various subsystems, conducting reporting and remote sensing through payload sensors, 
                           and achieving autonomous flight with synchronized systems. 
                           Furthermore, the competition entails obstacle identification, object detection, classification, localization, and airborne payload management.
